//! The permission broker: one shared registry of pending approval
//! requests, so prompts from *any* loop, the leader's or a worker's,
//! reach the same UI.
//!
//! Why this exists: the leader's loop communicates prompts by yielding
//! `ToolCallRequested`, which works because the UI drains that stream.
//! A subagent's loop runs *inside a tool*, nobody drains its stream.
//! Both loops register asks here; the UI subscribes once and answers by
//! request id. The loop still holds a plain oneshot receiver and awaits
//! it exactly as before, the broker is the queue in front.
//!
//! A dropped request (no answer ever) resolves as a deny in the loop:
//! when the UI goes away, doing nothing is the safe move.
